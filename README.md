## Project Overview

Given the review of a shoe product, is it possible to create a prediction system to accurately predict the rating given by a customer? By creating this prediction system, feature extraction can be performed to find key features that make up a good and bad review. A single product can have hundreds to thousands of reviews which could add up to millions of reviews when looking at a specific market with multiple products. This would make it extremely time-consuming to read every single review and process this information or feedback. Thus, by using feature extraction of the reviews prediction system, this would streamline this process and the most important features mentioned in reviews can be extracted which businesses or shoe designers can use this information to improve their future products.

## Modeling

4 types of modeling will be explored in this analysis; 

1. Logistic Regression
2. SVM (Support Vector Machines)
3. XGBoost 
4. Neural networks (specifically using BERT to classify text)

## Notebook order

The analysis is performed over multiple notebooks so the order to go through them is:

1. Cleaning Data
2. Basic Modeling 
3. Downsampled Modeling 
4. BERT modeling
