    "SVM did not perform any better than logisitic regression in terms of test score accuracy. This might have performed better if hyperparameter optimization was performed but the run-time of an hour for just 1 model (no cv either) with default parameters is not worth the trade off as it could just lead to a small increase in accuracy (<2% increase) like logistic regression. It might have performed better for the confusion matrix and f1-score so that will be examined next."
